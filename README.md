# CollegeWeeklyPlanner
Are you looking for more organization in your life? Than look no further, this project is for you!

### A Little Background
This project is based off of a weekly calendar format I've been using since middle school, which separates a normal week into individual classes to better keep track of different events and due dates for each course.

_This is an example of a week in the planner I used for one of my semesters at college. While it may look a bit messy, it helps me keep track of what days I have lots of due dates or work to focus on and allows me to plan my time better._

The calendar has three main features that separate it from a normal planner:

 - The ability to separate events by different classes
 - The ability to categorize events into different types (e.g. homework, exam, etc.)
 - And the ability to add extra notes like readings and tasks that aren't necessarily due dates

My aim in this creating this project was to not only create a useful tool for other students to hopefully use, but also learn more about front end development (especially JavaScript and CSS). 

There's still a long way to go on this project, so keep checking back for new updates.
